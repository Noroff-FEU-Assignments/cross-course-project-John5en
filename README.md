# Cross Course Project - Gamehub

## Description

My website about a digital video game shop. This is a project I have been working on through the first year at Noroff. It is also the first website i ever made. I was assigned to pick a theme for a page, there were several ones, and i landed on this, since i have an interest in video games. The site seeks out to be a competitive video game provider with good prices and which often has sales. The site is a hybrid between hardcoded content and content fetched from wordpress.

This website has:
- Home Page: Front page with company logo, and games underneath which shows what are trending, what are on sale, and what games are new. clikcing on a game takes you to the product details page. however this does not work on the games on the front page, since it interferes with the fetch data from the games that are shown on the games page.
- Games Page: A list of games that are fetched from wordpress. clicking on a game takes you to that product details page. You can also add it to the cart to take you to the my cart page.
- My Cart Page: a form with javascript validation giving you updates to what you need to fill in in the different forms.
- About and Contact us Pages: simple pages about what the site is about and how you can get in contact with the company.
